        <td width="33%">Central to the Spring Framework is its inversion of control (IoC) container, which provides a
            consistent means of configuring and managing Java objects using reflection. The container is responsible for
            managing object lifecycles of specific objects: creating these objects, calling their initialization
            methods, and configuring these objects by wiring them together.

            Objects created by the container are also called managed objects or beans. The container can be configured
            by loading XML (Extensible Markup Language) files or detecting specific Java annotations on configuration
            classes. These data sources contain the bean definitions that provide the information required to create the
            beans.

            Objects can be obtained by means of either dependency lookup or dependency injection.[12] Dependency lookup
            is a pattern where a caller asks the container object for an object with a specific name or of a specific
            type. Dependency injection is a pattern where the container passes objects by name to other objects, via
            either constructors, properties, or factory methods.

            In many cases one need not use the container when using other parts of the Spring Framework, although using
            it will likely make an application easier to configure and customize. The Spring container provides a
            consistent mechanism to configure applications and integrates with almost all Java environments, from
            small-scale applications to large enterprise applications.
