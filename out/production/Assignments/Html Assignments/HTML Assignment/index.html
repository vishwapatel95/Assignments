RandomText is a tool designers and developers can use to quickly grab dummy text in either Lorem Ipsum or <u>Gibberish format</u>.

There are a number of features that make RandomText a little different from other Lorem Ipsum dummy text generators you may find around the web....

Don't waste more time fiddling with form options! RandomText allows you to get at your text quicker by using the URL to construct a query...
